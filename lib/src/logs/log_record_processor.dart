  /// lightweight and avoid blocking operations or excessive processing.

  /// The logRecord parameter is a ReadWriteLogRecord, allowing processors
  /// to modify the log record. Mutations are visible in subsequent processors.

  /// @param context The context (explicit or current)
  /// @param instrumentationScope The instrumentation scope
  /// @param severityNumber The severity number of the potential log

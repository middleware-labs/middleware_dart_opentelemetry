[Middleware_Dart OTel](https://pub.dev/packages/middleware_dart_opentelemetry) is suitable for Dart backends, CLIs or any
Dart application.

[Dartastic OTel API](https://pub.dev/packages/dartastic_opentelemetry_api) is the API for the Dartastic OTel SDK.
The `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` exists as a standalone library to strictly adhere to the
OpenTelemetry specification which separates API and the SDK.  All OpenTelemetry API classes on in
`dartastic_opentelemetry_api`.

[Middleware_Flutter OTel](https://pub.dev/packages/middleware_flutter_opentelemetry) adds Middleware Dart OTel to Flutter apps with ease.

Middleware dart and flutter-sdk OTel are made with 💙

## Getting started

Include this in your pubspec.yaml:
```
dependencies:
  middleware_dart_opentelemetry: ^1.0.3
```

The entrypoint to the SDK is the `OTel` class.  `OTel` has static "factory" methods for all
OTel API and SDK objects.  `OTel` needs to be initialized first to point to an OpenTelemetry
backend.  Initialization does a lot of work under the hood including gathering a rich set of
standard resources for any OS that Dart runs in.  It prepares for the creation of the global
default `TracerProvider` with the serviceName and a default `Tracer`, both created on first use.
All configuration, include Trace and Metric exporters, can be made in code via `OTel.initialize()`.  
Codeless configuration can be done with standard OpenTelemetry environmental variables either 
through POSIX variable or `-D` or `--define` for Dart or with `--dart-define` for Flutter apps.

## Environment Variables

Middleware Dart OpenTelemetry ~~supports~~ is working on support for all standard OpenTelemetry environment variables as defined in the [OpenTelemetry Specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/).

Environment variables provide a convenient way to configure OpenTelemetry without hardcoding values. 
All environment variable names are available as strongly-typed constants in the SDK for compile-time 
safety and IDE autocomplete. See `lib/src/environment/env_constants.dart` for a complete list.

### How It Works

Dart environment variables can be set in two ways:

1. **System Environment Variables** (Non-web only): Traditional POSIX environment variables
   ```bash
   export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   dart run
   ```

2. **Compile-time Constants** (All platforms including Flutter web): Passed during compilation/execution

   **For Dart commands** (`dart run`, `dart compile`, `dart test`):
   ```bash
   # Using --define (or -D shorthand)
   dart run --define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   dart compile exe -D=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service -o myapp
   dart test -DOTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   ```

   **For Flutter commands**:
   ```bash
   # Flutter uses --dart-define (note the different flag name)
   flutter run --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   flutter build apk --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   ```

**Priority**: Compile-time constants (`--define` or `--dart-define`) take precedence over system environment variables. 
Explicit parameters to `OTel.initialize()` override both.  Thus, POSIX env vars cannot override `--dart-define`s and
neither POSIX env vars nor `--dart-define`s can override code.  This is sensible and reduces security vectors.

**Web Support**: Flutter web and Dart web only support compile-time constants (`--define` or `--dart-define`), as browser environments don't have access to system environment variables.

### Using Environment Variable Constants

All OpenTelemetry environment variable names are available as typed constants:

```dart
import 'package:middleware_dart_opentelemetry/middleware_dart_opentelemetry.dart';

void main() {
  // Reference constants instead of strings
  final serviceName = EnvironmentService.instance.getValue(otelServiceName);
  final endpoint = EnvironmentService.instance.getValue(otelExporterOtlpEndpoint);
  
  print('Service: $serviceName');
  print('Endpoint: $endpoint');
}
```

Constants are defined for all 74 OpenTelemetry environment variables. See `lib/src/environment/env_constants.dart` for the complete list.

### Usage Examples

#### Dart Application with Environment Variables

Note the ',' in OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES for POSIX env vars but a ';' for --dart-define.  This is due to a Dart quirk.

```bash
# Set environment variables
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-backend-service
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.version=1.2.3,deployment.environment=prod"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otel-collector:4318
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=your-key
export OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run your application
dart run bin/my_app.dart
```

#### Flutter Application with --dart-define

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-flutter-app \
  --dart-define=OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.version=1.2.3;deployment.environment=prod"
  --dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otel-collector:4317 \
  --dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
  --dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=your-key
```

#### Flutter Web (requires --dart-define)

```bash
# Web MUST use --dart-define (environment variables don't work in browsers)
flutter run -d chrome \
  --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-web-app \
  --dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://collector:4318
```

#### Combining Both (--dart-define wins)

```bash
# Environment variable
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=from-environment

# --dart-define takes precedence
dart run --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=from-dart-define

# Result: Uses "from-dart-define"
```

#### In Code

```dart
import 'package:middleware_dart_opentelemetry/middleware_dart_opentelemetry.dart';

void main() async {
  // OTel.initialize() automatically reads environment variables
  // when parameters are not explicitly provided
  await OTel.initialize();
  
  // Environment variables are read automatically:
  // - OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
  // - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
  // - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL
  // - And 90+ others...
  
  // Explicit parameters override environment variables
  await OTel.initialize(
    serviceName: 'explicit-service',  // Overrides OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
    endpoint: 'https://override:4318', // Overrides OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
  );
  
  // You can also read environment variables directly
  final endpoint = EnvironmentService.instance.getValue(otelExporterOtlpEndpoint);
  print('Using endpoint: $endpoint');
}
```

### Testing with Environment Variables

Integration tests can use real environment variables:

```bash
# Run tests with environment variables
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=test-service dart test

# Run tests with --dart-define
dart test --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=test-service

# Run the provided integration test script
./tool/test_env_vars.sh
```

The SDK includes an integration test suite (`test/integration/environment_variables_test.dart`) and a test script (`tool/test_env_vars.sh`) that demonstrates proper environment variable usage.

### Minimal Code Example

```dart
import 'package:middleware_dart_opentelemetry/middleware_dart_opentelemetry.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize - automatically reads environment variables
  await OTel.initialize();

  // Get the default tracer
  final tracer = OTel.tracer();

  // Create a span
  final span = tracer.startSpan('my-operation');
  
  try {
    // Your code here
    await doWork();
  } catch (e, stackTrace) {
    span.recordException(e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
    span.setStatus(SpanStatusCode.error, 'Operation failed');
  } finally {
    span.end();
  }
}
```

Since middleware_opentelemetry exports all the classes of `opentelemetry_api`, refer to
`opentelemetry_api` for documentation of API classes.

See the `/example` folder for more examples.

## OpenTelemetry Metrics API

The Metrics API in OpenTelemetry provides a way to record measurements about your application. These measurements can be exported later as metrics, allowing you to monitor and analyze the performance and behavior of your application.

### Concepts

- **MeterProvider**: Entry point to the metrics API, responsible for creating Meters
- **Meter**: Used to create instruments for recording measurements
- **Instrument**: Used to record measurements
  - Synchronous instruments: record measurements at the moment of calling their APIs
  - Asynchronous instruments: collect measurements on demand via callbacks

### Instrument Types

- **Counter**: Synchronous, monotonic increasing counter (can only go up)
- **UpDownCounter**: Synchronous, non-monotonic counter (can go up or down)
- **Histogram**: Synchronous, aggregable measurements with statistical distributions
- **Gauge**: Synchronous, non-additive value that represents current state
- **ObservableCounter**: Asynchronous version of Counter
- **ObservableUpDownCounter**: Asynchronous version of UpDownCounter
- **ObservableGauge**: Asynchronous version of Gauge

### Usage Pattern

Similar to the Tracing API, the metrics API follows a multi-layered factory pattern:

1. **API Layer**: Defines interfaces and provides no-op implementations
2. **SDK Layer**: Provides concrete implementations
3. **Flutter Layer**: Adds UI-specific functionality

The API follows the pattern of using factory methods for creation rather than constructors:

```dart
// Get a meter from the meter provider
final meter = OTel.meterProvider().getMeter('component_name');

// Create a counter instrument
final counter = meter.createCounter('my_counter');

// Record measurements
counter.add(1, {'attribute_key': 'attribute_value'});
```

For asynchronous instruments:

```dart
// Create an observable counter
final observableCounter = meter.createObservableCounter(
  'my_observable_counter',
  () => [Measurement(10, {'attribute_key': 'attribute_value'})],
);
```

### Understanding Metric Types and When to Use Them

| Instrument Type         | Use Case                                                        | Example                          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Counter                 | Count things that only increase                                 | Request count, completed tasks   |
| UpDownCounter           | Count things that can increase or decrease                      | Active requests, queue size      |
| Histogram               | Measure distributions                                           | Request durations, payload sizes |
| Gauge                   | Record current value                                            | CPU usage, memory usage          |
| ObservableCounter       | Count things that only increase, collected on demand            | Total CPU time                   |
| ObservableUpDownCounter | Count things that can increase or decrease, collected on demand | Memory usage                     |
| ObservableGauge         | Record current value, collected on demand                       | Current temperature              |

## Integration with Dart/Flutter

This API implementation follows the same pattern as the tracing API, where the creation of objects is managed through
factory methods. This allows for a clear separation between API and SDK, and ensures that the metrics functionality
can be used in a no-op mode when the SDK is not initialized.
